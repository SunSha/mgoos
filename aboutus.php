When they registered this site they thought they would create online operating system, but they found it was not that much appealing to Internet users.<BR/><BR/>At the time of registration of this site they got hosting space of 10 GB by web server hosting company, which was after a period of time upgraded to 50 GB. So, eventually they decided to explore music from their site. To achieve that they have upload MP3 files, this was restrictive by Web Server Hosting as per rules. After two months they revised their plan and started working to make it MP3 search engine, by which people can explore music in a better way. It was appealing to users and appreciated by many.<BR/><BR/>As the time passed on, the music search engine was updated and enhanced. The search engine was especially made for users to listen the songs on the search engine itself, they are not required to move to any media players to listen the song. The music search engine is to search audio/mp3 files. They all worked on the philosophy <span class="boldfont" >“The combination of hard work and smart work brings efficient work”</span>.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><span class="boldfont" >“Words make you think thought. Music makes you feel a feeling. A song makes you feel a thought.”</span>  - By E.Y. Harbug</p></BR>
